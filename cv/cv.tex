% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\textbf{Research}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Applied data science to improve system for entity resolution of noisy music metadata from multiple sources. Achieved -60\% false positives, model in production.
\item Improved audio fingerprinting technology for background music and pitch-shifting. Gained +300\% id-rate in challenging scenarios for the main company product.
\item Built music detection system using machine learning. Best algorithm in \href{https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2018:Music_and_or_Speech_Detection_Results}{MIREX 2018}.
\end{tightemize}
\textbf{Development}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented core audio fingerprinting algorithm in C++11. Achieved -80\% in computational cost with respect to previous legacy code. In production. Running 24/7 in production in >4000 CPU cores.
\item Implementation of music detection system with TensorFlow C++ API. In production.
\item Developed several audio and video annotation web tools. Backend in Django, frontend with Bootstrap and Javascript. Used by external freelances for QA processes.
\item Implemented several HTTP REST APIs (Flask, FastAPI, Django) in order to provide our techs as microservices for other applications in the company.
