I typically do research and data science in python (jupyter, keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas, django, essentia, librosa, etc.), and I develop production code mainly in python and C++.</p>
                <p>Regarding my background, I have a PhD by University of Málaga in the field of Music Information Retrieval, a MSc degree in sound and music computing at the Music Technology Group of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona), and a degree in telecommunications engineering (audio and image specialty) in University of Málaga.</p>
