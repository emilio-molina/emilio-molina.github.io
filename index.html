                <p>I am a Research Engineer at Barcelona Music & Audio Technologies (BMAT), in the R&D team, where we work in two main fields: audio fingerprinting and music/speech detection. Our main job is to explore new approaches in order to improve our technology, and to implement them into production-ready code. I typically do my research in python (jupyter, keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas, django, essentia, librosa, etc.), but our production code is implemented in C++11.</p>
                <p>Regarding my background, I have a PhD by University of Málaga in the field of Music Information Retrieval, a MSc degree in sound and music computing at the Music Technology Group of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona), and a degree in telecommunications engineering (audio and image specialty) in University of Málaga.</p>
