                <p>I am a Research & Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.bmat.com/">BMAT</a> since 2015. From the research side, I explore new technologies on audio signal processing, and music metadata entity resolution, in order to open new business opportunities. From the development side, I implement production code for these technologies in Python and C++ (running currently 24/7 in >4000 CPU cores).</p>
